# 🌍 Global Disaster Dashboard
This project is an interactive data exploration tool designed to analyze global natural and man-made disasters. Built with Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab), it allows users to visualize trends in disaster frequency, duration, damage, deaths, and international aid.

The dashboard supports interactive filtering by region and disaster type, and includes log-scale visualizations to make large disparities in the data more interpretable. With clean, modular code using Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and IPyWidgets, this tool serves as both a data analysis platform and an educational resource for exploring the global impact of disasters.
